R\+T1 -\/ Assignment 2 -\/ R\+OS Simulator {\bfseries{Professor\+: Carmine Tommaso Recchiuto, Student\+: Aurora Bottino (s4814504)}}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Assignment Description}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1}
Starting from the package assignment\+\_\+2\+\_\+2022 (\href{https://github.com/CarmineD8/assignment_2_2022}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Carmine\+D8/assignment\+\_\+2\+\_\+2022}}), which provides an implementation of an action server that moves a robot in the environment by implementing the bug0 algorithm, the following project creates a new package in which three nodes are developed\+:

(a) A node that implements an action client, allowing the user to set a target (x, y) or to cancel it. The node also publishes the robot position and velocity as a custom message (x,y, vel\+\_\+x, vel\+\_\+z), by relying on the values published on the topic /odom.

(b) A service node that, when called, prints the number of goals reached and cancelled.

(c) A node that subscribes to the robot’s position and velocity (using the custom message) and prints the distance of the robot from the target and the robot’s average speed. Use a parameter to set how fast the node publishes the information.

In addition it is required to create a launch file in order to start the whole program. \hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Nodes}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md2}
There are six nodes in the package\+:

{\bfseries{bug\+\_\+as.\+py}}\+: the action server node that calls the services to move the robot to the goal position

{\bfseries{go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point\+\_\+service.\+py}}\+: the service node to move the robot to the goal position

{\bfseries{wall\+\_\+follow\+\_\+service.\+py}}\+: the service node to avoid obstacles

and then I implemented the three nodes requested\+:

{\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{print__info_8py}{print\+\_\+info.\+py}}}}\+: the node that subscribes to the robot’s position and velocity from the /\+Position\+\_\+velocity as a custom message and prints the distance of the robot from the target and the robot’s average speed with a frequency setted as a parameter in the lauch file.

{\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{service_8py}{service.\+py}}}}\+: the service node that prints the number of goals reached and cancelled.

{\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{user__input_8py}{user\+\_\+input.\+py}}}}\+: the action client node which allows the user to set a goal position with coordinates x and y, or to cancel it. The node also publishes the robot position and velocity as a custom message on the /\+Position\+\_\+velocity topic, by relying on the values published on the topic /odom. The structure of the node is described in the following flowchart\+:

1) Start the master\+: {\bfseries{roscore \&}} 3) Go inside the src folder of R\+OS workspace and clone the assignment folder\+: {\bfseries{\href{https://github.com/AuroraBottino/assignment_2_2022.git}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Aurora\+Bottino/assignment\+\_\+2\+\_\+2022.\+git}}}} 4) Run the command\+: {\bfseries{catkin\+\_\+make}} 5) Install\+: {\bfseries{sudo apt-\/get install xterm}} 6) Run\+: {\bfseries{roslaunch assignment\+\_\+2\+\_\+2022 assignment1.\+launch}}. If everything works correctly, the following windows will be opening\+:



plus the user\+\_\+input (where the user enters the coordinates) and the print\+\_\+info windows. \hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Possible improvements\+:}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}
Some improvements that can be done are\+: 1) Having a more clear view of the goal position the robot has to reach\+: this could be done adding a graphical marker or creating a function that allows us to recognize the size of the arena, in order to bound the coordinates. 2) Improving the bug0 algorithm\+: sometimes the robot reaches the wall and is not able to move anymore or it chooses itself which direction it\textquotesingle{}s better to take to reach the goal.
